 Setup React.js Project
First, initialize a new React.js project with TypeScript. If you haven't set up TypeScript yet, you can add it to your project later:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-chart-app --template typescript
cd my-chart-app
2. Choose a Charting Library
For this example, let's use Chart.js as the charting library because it provides robust support for various chart types and interactions.

bash
Copy code
npm install chart.js
3. JSON Data Handling
Create a JSON file (data.json) to serve chart data. Ensure it contains sufficient data points (at least 100 points) with timestamps and values as shown in your example structure.
4.Create a Components 
5.For run : npm start
6. Styling and Enhancements
You can enhance the app further by adding buttons or dropdowns for timeframe breakdowns and implementing zooming functionality using Chart.js's built-in zoom features or custom handlers.

Exporting Chart as PNG/JPG
To export the chart as PNG/JPG, you might need to use additional libraries or canvas-based solutions to generate an image from the chart canvas.
